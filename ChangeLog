		CHANGES IN PHYLOCLIM VERSION 0.6
      
BUG FIXES

    o There was mistake in the formala for the calculation of 
      Hellingers distance in the original publication of Warren,
      Glor and Turelli (2008, Evolution 62:2868-2883; see also
      http://enmtools.blogspot.com/2010/09/error-in-i-metric-but-
      dont-panic.html). The corrected formula is now implemented
      in getDI. As stressed by Dan Warren the error is only a
      scaling issue and does not affect the p-values of the tests 
      based upon it. (thanks to Pascal Title for bug report)

BUG FIXES

    o Function bg.similarity.test was mislead by different 
      choices of column names in the SWD files, e.g. "species" 
      instead of "spec". The function can now handle any column 
      name. (thanks to Pascal Title for bug report)
